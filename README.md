# Decision-Support-System-for-Resource-Utilization
Decision-making in the field of academic planning involves extensive analysis of

large data volumes originating from multiple systems. With the many new technology

application areas evolving from the domain of electrical engineering, computer

engineering, and computer science, deans and department chairs must ensure that new

specializations and programs are adequately supported.

Academic workload management is concerned with distributing teaching

resources to support the university’s educational framework adequately (faculties,

degrees, courses, admission policies, teaching workload, etc.).

This system presents a methodology for assessing educational capacity and

planning its distribution and utilization, implemented as a decision support system

allowing simulation and evaluation of various proposals and scenarios. The system

integrates input data from relevant sources into an autonomous data warehouse.

Graphical client front-end ensures adequate output presentation to the decision-makers by

revealing significant details and dependencies in the data.

Applying the system as an “on-the-fly” decision-support utility by the policy-
makers leads to significant acceleration of planning procedures, deepens the insight into

the data and the underlying methodology, and, consequently, provides for more efficient

academic administration.
